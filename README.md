  hello ... I am a student web-developer, learning html5, css, javascript, java, linux, mobile app design, networking and more. 
i like listening to Scott T. and Wes B. on 'Tasty Treats' and the folks on 'The Web Platform Podcast'. In addition to learning how to code, i'm into art/photography, travel, music, nature walks, hiking, camping and running. i'm looking forward to exploring this community.
